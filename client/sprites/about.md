Sprites are a binnary format, so it should not be tracked by git.
Git tracks individual parts of the file, so it copies and keeps a lot of data when the data is large, just like binaries are.
Inside this folder, you must have some sprites depending on the objects you have in the game session.

A better sync system may be implemented, but today (early dev days) the only thing you need is a ./bluemage.png for the players being printed.
