## now
- Controlls needs to be thinked

## Mid-term things
- How do I manage controlls? And other signals from the user?
- Extend and abstract messaging
  - I must have more than one type of messages
  - Didn't websockets have it's own way of doing it?

## long term things that I already know are problems but don't have time to:
- Manage & disconnection
- do something with room.End
  - I may need a waitgroup =(
